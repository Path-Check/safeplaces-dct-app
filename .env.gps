# This is the GPS debug/dev .env file. Any debug or non-release-signed build will
# use these flags.

# About flags:
# ------------
# Any variables that start with flag_ will be available to the <Flag> component
# For now, only true/1 is parsed, everything else will be interpretted as false
# flags must begin with flag_ and are case sensitive
