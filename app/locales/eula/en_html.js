                        . Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the
            Apple App Store (an“App Store Sourced Application”</strong>
                      ), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs
            the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the “Usage Rules”
            set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the first sentence in this section, with
            respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play store (a “
            Google Play Sourced Application</strong>”), you may have additional
            license rights with respect to use of the Application on a shared basis within your designated family
            group.</p>
    <p id="h.gjdgxs"><strong>1.4 Updates.</strong>
            You understand that to keep the Application most useful for App Users and to accommodate bug fixes and other
            technological changes, PCI may make updates to the Application after you download the Application.
            These updates will be made available to App Users from the third party from whom you received the
            Application license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play (each, an “App Store
            ”</strong>). You will have the ability, at your
            option, to download any updates to the Application that we make freely available through such channels.
            We do not require you to install any updates in order for you to continue using the Application after
            we make such updates available. This is because we do not retain any information about you when you
            download the Application. Therefore, we will not know whether you have installed any such updates.
            Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that if you elect NOT to install available updates, the
            Application may not operate in accordance with publicly available documentation regarding the features and
            functionality of the Application, which documentation may be updated after the time you originally
            downloaded it. In addition, you may need to update third-party software from time to time in order to
            use the Application. Any updates issued by PCI and installed by you shall be deemed the Application
            and shall be governed by this Safe Places EULA or any subsequent end user license agreement accompanying the
            update.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1.5 Necessary Equipment and Software.</strong>
             You must provide all equipment and software necessary to download and use the Application
            and to connect to any third party services or sites, including but not limited to, a mobile device that is
            suitable to connect with and use the Application. You are solely responsible for any fees, including
            Internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing the Application. </p>
    <p><strong>1.6 Responsibility for Location History and Other Data
            Collected and Stored by You. </strong>PCI has no access to the Location History or any
            other data you collect, receive and store in the installed Application or otherwise on your mobile device.
            Therefore, PCI has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or accuracy of the Location History
            or other data you collect, receive or store in the Application or the failure to store, transmit or receive
            transmission of Location History or other data; or the security, privacy, storage, or transmission of other
            communications originating with or involving use of the Application. </p>
    <p><strong>2. OWNERSHIP.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>2.1 Application.</strong> Except with
            respect to your Location History and other data you may collect, retrieve from third parties and store in
            the Application on your device, you agree that PCI and its suppliers own all rights, title and interest in
            and to the Application. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark
            or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Application.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Trademarks.</strong>COVID Safe
            Paths and all related graphics, logos, service marks and trade names used on or in connection with the
            Application or in connection therewith are the trademarks of PCI and may not be used without permission in
            connection with your, or any third-party, products or services. Other trademarks, service marks and
            trade names that may appear on or in the Application are the property of their respective owners.</p>
    <p><strong>3. COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL
            INFORMATION. </strong>You acknowledge that the Application
            may collect personal information about you (through your choice to store information in the Application or
            through automatic technology tools), including your Location History. You acknowledge that the
            Application may provide you with opportunities to share personal information about yourself, including your
            Location History with others. All personal information in connection with this Application is subject to our
            Privacy Policy. By downloading, installing, using, and providing personal information to or through this
            Application, you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your personal information in compliance
            with the Privacy Policy. For some features of the Application, specific consent is required. In
            addition, you may choose to disclose, through other means not associated with the Application, any part of
            your personal information to family members, doctors, health care providers, governmental agencies, or other
            individuals or entities. We recommend that you make your choices regarding sharing your personal
            information, through the Application or otherwise, carefully. We will have no liability for any
            consequences that may result because you have released or shared information, through the Application or
            otherwise, with a third party. </p>
    <p><strong>4. FEEDBACK</strong>. If you provide
            PCI with any ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals (“Feedback”
            </strong>) via email or another means, you do so at your
            own risk and you acknowledge and agree that PCI has no obligations (including without limitation obligations
            of confidentiality) with respect to such Feedback. You represent and warrant that you have all rights
            necessary to submit the Feedback. You hereby grant to PCI a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual,
            irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, perform,
            display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or
            non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all Feedback, and to sublicense the foregoing rights, in
            connection with the operation and maintenance of the Application, any other PCI products or services, or
            PCI’s business.</p>
    <p><strong>5. APP STORES.
            </strong>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application is
            dependent on the App Store from whom you received the Application license. You acknowledge that this
            Agreement is between you and PCI and not with the App Store. PCI, not the App Store, is solely
            responsible for the Application, including the content PCI makes available therein, and the maintenance,
            support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product
            liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the Application,
            you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access.
            You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Application.
            You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is conditioned upon your compliance
            with all terms of agreement imposed by the applicable App Store when using the Application. You acknowledge
            that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will have the
            right to enforce it.</p>
    <p><strong>6. FEES. </strong>No fees shall be
            payable under this Agreement for the rights granted under this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that
            this fee arrangement is made in consideration for the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement,
            including your obligations hereunder, and the disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability set
            forth herein.</p>
    <p><strong>7. INDEMNIFICATION. </strong>You
            agree to indemnify and hold PCI, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, volunteers,
            agents, partners, suppliers, and licensors (each, a “PCI Party
                      ” and collectively, the “PCI Parties”
                      ) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
            attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of any and all of the following: (a) your use of, or
            inability to use the Application; (b) your violation of this Agreement; (c) your violation of any rights of
            another party; or (d) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. PCI reserves the
            right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to
            indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with PCI in asserting any available
            defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the PCI Parties for any
            unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise,
            misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the
            Application provided hereunder. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination
            of this Agreement and/or your use of or access to Application.</p>
    <p><strong>8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>8.1 As Is.</strong>YOU EXPRESSLY
            UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR
            SOLE RISK, AND THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS,
            WITH ALL FAULTS. THE PCI PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND CONDITIONS OF
            ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
            MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARISING FROM USE OF THE APPLICATION.
            </p>
    <p><strong>(a) </strong>THE PCI PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR
            CONDITION THAT: (1) THE APPLICATION OR ITS FEATURES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (2) YOUR USE OF THE
            APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE; OR (3) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED
            FROM USE OF THE APPLICATION WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.</p>
    <p><strong>(b) </strong>ANY CONTENT DOWNLOADED FROM OR OTHERWISE ACCESSED THROUGH
            THE APPLICATION IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND YOU SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR
            PROPERTY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM AND ANY DEVICE YOU USE TO ACCESS THE
            APPLICATION, OR ANY OTHER LOSS THAT RESULTS FROM ACCESSING SUCH CONTENT.</p>
    <p><strong>(c) </strong>THE AVAILABILITY OF THE APPLICATION AND ITS FEATURES MAY
            BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS, CANCELLATIONS AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS. PCI MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR
            CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OR ITS FEATURES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE QUALITY,
            EFFECTIVENESS, REPUTATION AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS THEREOF.</p>
    <p><strong>(d) </strong>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN,
            OBTAINED FROM PCI OR THROUGH THE APPLICATION WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.</p>
    <p><strong>(e) </strong>FROM TIME TO TIME, PCI MAY OFFER NEW “BETA”
            FEATURES OR TOOLS WITH WHICH ITS USERS MAY EXPERIMENT. SUCH FEATURES OR TOOLS ARE OFFERED SOLELY FOR
            EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND MAY BE MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT
            PCI’S SOLE DISCRETION. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION APPLY WITH FULL FORCE TO SUCH FEATURES OR
            TOOLS.</p>
    <p><strong>8.2 NOT INTENDED AS MEDICAL ADVICE.</strong>
            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INFORMATION IN THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL
            INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT INTENDED AS MEDICAL ADVICE OF ANY KIND NOR IS IT INTENDED TO
            DIAGNOSE, TREAT, CURE OR PREVENT ANY DISEASE OR MEDICAL CONDITION. THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE
            APPLICATION SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED OR CONSTRUED IN ANY WAY AS A REPLACEMENT OR SUBSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL
            ADVICE PROVIDED BY YOUR DOCTOR OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. YOU SHOULD NOT DISREGARD, AVOID
            OR DELAY OBTAINING MEDICAL ADVICE OR TREATMENT FROM YOUR DOCTOR OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROVIDER DUE
            TO ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE APPLICATION. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU ALTER YOUR EXISTING
            MEDICAL TREATMENT, MEDICATION REGIMEN, OR ANY OTHER RELATED HEALTHCARE ACTIVITIES BASED ON ANY INFORMATION
            PROVIDED IN THE APPLICATION. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO DISCUSS YOUR TREATMENT OPTIONS, AND ANY QUESTIONS
            THAT YOU MAY HAVE, WITH YOUR DOCTOR OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.</p>
    <p><strong>8.3 </strong>In making the Application available for download,
            PCI’s goal is to provide individuals with a useful tool for contact tracing. However, the
            utility of the Application’s features is dependent upon a number of factors that are outside the
            control of PCI, such as the reliability of GPS sensors, whether individuals are carrying their mobile
            devices, as well as the accuracy, reliability, availability, effectiveness or correct use of
            individual’s mobile devices and GPS sensors, all of which are used to create Location History, and for
            any Publicly Available Safe Places Data that you may upload into your Application from third party source,
            the accuracy and completeness of such data. Your Location History or other data may be unavailable,
            inaccurate or incomplete. Use of the Application should not replace your good judgment and common
            sense. </p>
    <p><strong>8.4 No Liability for Conduct of Third Parties.</strong>
             YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT PCI PARTIES ARE NOT LIABLE, AND YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK TO
            HOLD PCI PARTIES LIABLE, FOR THE CONDUCT OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING THE ACTIONS OF ANY THIRD
            PARTY OPERATING A THIRD PARTY SAFE PLACES WEB APP OR ANY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY WITH WHICH YOU CHOOSE TO
            INTERACT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION, AND THAT THE RISK OF INJURY FROM SUCH THIRD PARTIES
            RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.</p>
    <p><strong>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>9.1 Disclaimer of Certain Damages.</strong>
             YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PCI PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF
            PROFITS, PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, WRONGFUL DEATH, REVENUE OR DATA, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
            OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES OR COSTS DUE TO LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
            PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, IN EACH CASE WHETHER OR NOT PCI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ON ANY THEORY OF
            LIABILITY, RESULTING FROM: (1) THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION OR ANY OF ITS ADVERTISED
            FEATURES; (2) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; OR (3) ANY OTHER
            MATTER RELATED TO THE APPLICATION, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, COPYRIGHT, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
            NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. THE FOREGOING CAP ON LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY OF
            A PCI PARTY FOR (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY A PCI PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE; OR FOR (B) ANY INJURY
            CAUSED BY A PCI PARTY’S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION. </p>
    <p><strong>9.2 Cap on Liability.</strong> TO THE
            MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO
            YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE (FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS
            OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM OF FIFTY US DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE
            EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT. YOU AGREE THAT OUR SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE
            NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE.</p>
    <p><strong>9.3 Your Data.</strong> EXCEPT FOR
            PCI’S OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA AS SET FORTH IN THE PCI’S PRIVACY POLICY, PCI
            ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY CONTENT
            (INCLUDING YOUR LOCATION HISTORY), USER COMMUNICATIONS OR PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS.</p>
    <p><strong>9.4 Basis of the Bargain.</strong>
            THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN PCI
            AND YOU.</p>

    <p id="h.30j0zll"><strong>13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</strong>
             <strong>Please read the following
            arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement
            ”) carefully. It requires U.S. users to arbitrate disputes with PCI and limits the
            manner in which you can seek relief from us. </strong></p>
    <p id="h.1fob9te"><strong>13.1 Applicability of Arbitration
            Agreement</strong>.You agree that any dispute, claim, or
            request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Application or to any aspect of your
            relationship with PCI, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you
            may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify,; and (2) you or PCI may seek
            equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as
            trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong>
            This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and
            requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior
            version of this Agreement. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>13.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum</strong>
            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
            enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter
            requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered
            agentSamuel Hoff c/o Pierce &amp; Mandell, P.C. 11
            Beacon Street Suite 800, Boston MA 02108. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established
            alternative dispute resolution provider.Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for
            relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s
            most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
            http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s
            most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
            http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at
            www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties
            will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay
            JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, PCI
            will pay them for you. In addition, PCI will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative,
            hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the
            arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. </p>
    <p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
            submissions, or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
            arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
    <p><strong>13.3 Authority of Arbitrator</strong>
            . The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and
            enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
            applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any
            assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will
            decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and PCI. The arbitration proceeding will not be
            consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall
            have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
            authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
            individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the
            Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
            essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages
            awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in
            a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
        </p>
    <p><strong>13.4 Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>
            . YOU AND PCI HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE
            A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and PCI are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or
            requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified
            in Section 13.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a
            court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in
            arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. </p>
    <p id="h.3znysh7"><strong>13.5 Waiver of Class or Other
            Non-Individualized Relief</strong>. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

            OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER
            CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued
            stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a
            given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and
            brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All other
            disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. </p>
